# charlieplex6

The experiment was to see how quickly I could charlieplex 2 x 3-led bar displays and drive it with a Raspberry Pi (2). Breadboarding was fairly simple - figuring it out on Fritzing took longer!

The Raspberry Pi is mounted on the "official" touchscreen (which is not being used here) and is running from a 20Ah LiPo pack.
